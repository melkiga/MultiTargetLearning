Our paper entitled "Multi-Target Support Vector Regression Via Correlation Regressor Chains" was submitted to you looking for the opportunity to be published in your prestigious journal. I verify that the manuscript is original material that has not been published, is not being considered for publication elsewhere, and will not be submitted anywhere else during the review process. I also verify that the research presented in this paper is author's own work, all authors have checked the manuscript and have agreed to the submission.
